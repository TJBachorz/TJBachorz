# <div align="center">ðŸ‘‰ Greetings, fellow nerds! I'm TJ! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘€</div>

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a background in film production and beer brewing operations, located in Colorado's Denver Metro area.  I love learning new technologies and applying them to new problems.  When I'm not programming I can often be found practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, PC gaming, or going on a scenic hike.

## Software Engineering Projects:
  
- **ABC Data Logger** - ([Frontend](https://github.com/TJBachorz/ABC-Data-Logger-FE) | [Backend](https://github.com/TJBachorz/ABC_Data_Logger_BE) | [Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/ceb43bedf201465f8bec3eee151d2bbd))

    * Families of children with developmental disabilities have a silent daily struggle that only gets more difficult when they have to log data during times when therapists are not present. The ABC Data Logger is a mobile app created using React Native with a Python/Django backend that seeks to make this data logging quick and efficient. Users can create cases and file incident reports for a specific child or client.  Parents can also link their accounts with spouses, therapists, and caretakers so that everyone involved with caring for the child can log data, all in the same place.
  
  
- **Epic Beer Run** - ([Frontend](https://github.com/TJBachorz/Epic-Beer-Run-FE) | [Backend](https://github.com/TJBachorz/Epic-Beer-Run-BE) | [Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/b6fc55760ca9464a8a4d99d714bfb18e) | [Hosted](https://epic-beer-run.web.app/))
    * A fun web app to pay homage to my years spent running brewery operations.  Built in React, and using the react-simple-maps package and TOPOJSON file structure, this fun and interactive US map allows users to sort breweries by state, visit their websites, and add them to their roadtrip itinerary. Users can then drag-and-drop their brewery destinations in order to play with the structure of their trip.  
    
- **Looksy** - ([Frontend](https://github.com/TJBachorz/looksy-frontend) | [Backend](https://github.com/TJBachorz/looksy_backend) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPJ6KVPMPac))
    * A mobile web app that leverages augmented reality to allow users to virtually decorate their homes, apartments, and yards in real time. Create a profile, upload an avatar, and then use your phones camera to size and place 3D models in your real-world environment.
